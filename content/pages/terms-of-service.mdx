# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, online forms, communication channels, and any related services provided by our healthcare practice ("we", "us", "our"). By accessing or using our website or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you should not use our website or services.

Effective date: 21 October 2025

We provide professional healthcare services in South Africa subject to applicable laws, clinical standards, and the Ethical Rules of Conduct issued by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA).

## Scope and acceptance

These Terms apply to all visitors and users of our website and to any online interactions you have with us (including enquiries, appointment requests, and educational content). Additional consent forms or clinical agreements may apply when receiving care; if there is a conflict, the clinical documents prevail for clinical services.

## Not medical advice and emergencies

- Website content is provided for general informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
- Do not ignore or delay seeking professional medical advice because of information on this website.
- In a medical emergency, call your local emergency number or seek immediate care. Do not use the website for urgent or emergency situations.

## Eligibility and acceptable use

By using our website, you agree to:

- Use the website only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
- Provide accurate, current, and complete information when submitting forms or contacting us.
- Not attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems, interfere with the website’s operation, or introduce malware or harmful code.
- Not harvest or misuse information from the website, or infringe any person’s privacy or intellectual property rights.

We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law.

## Appointments, communications, and online forms

- Submitting an enquiry or appointment request does not create a practitioner–patient relationship until confirmed by our practice.
- Communications over email, WhatsApp, or web forms may be subject to network and platform limitations. Please avoid sending highly sensitive information via unsecured channels.
- We may contact you using the details you provide to coordinate appointments, send reminders, or respond to enquiries. You can opt out of non-essential messages.

## Privacy and POPIA

We process personal information in accordance with the Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013 (POPIA) and applicable healthcare regulations. Please review our Privacy Policy for details about what we collect, how we use it, disclosures to operators, cross-border transfers, your rights, and our security measures. Where consent is required, you may withdraw it at any time, subject to legal and clinical requirements.

## Professional standards and HPCSA compliance

We adhere to the HPCSA Ethical Rules of Conduct and relevant Booklet guidance, including rules on professional conduct, confidentiality, telehealth, and health-related advertising. Content on this website and any promotional material is intended to be ethical, accurate, and not misleading. If you believe any content does not meet HPCSA standards, please contact us using the details above.

## Intellectual property

Unless otherwise indicated, the website and its content (including text, graphics, logos, icons, and design) are owned by or licensed to us and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, adapt, or publicly display website content without our prior written consent, except for personal, non-commercial use.

## Third-party services and links

Our website may contain links to third-party websites or use third-party tools (e.g., hosting, analytics, maps, messaging). We are not responsible for third-party content, practices, or policies. Your use of third-party websites or services is at your own risk and subject to their terms and privacy policies.

## Content accuracy and changes

We aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information; however, healthcare knowledge evolves and content may change without notice. We make no warranties that website content is complete, accurate, or current. We may modify or discontinue parts of the website at any time.

## Disclaimers

- The website is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
- Information on the website is not intended to create a practitioner–patient relationship or to replace consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.
- We do not warrant that the website will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from harmful components.

## Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by South African law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, goodwill, or business interruption, arising from or related to your use of the website or reliance on its content. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amount, if any, paid by you to use the website in the 3 months preceding the claim (which is typically R0 for website access).

Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such limitation is not permitted by law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by gross negligence.

## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your breach of these Terms or your misuse of the website.

## No waiver; severability

Failure to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of that provision. If any provision is found unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the unlawful provision will be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to be lawful.

## Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the South African courts (with venue reasonably determined by our principal place of business) for any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the website.

## Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page with the effective date above. Your continued use of the website after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
