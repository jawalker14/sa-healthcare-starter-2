# About our practice

We’re a community‑focused primary care practice serving individuals and families in Cape Town. Our clinicians aim to provide clear, practical guidance tailored to your needs. We work within professional standards set by the HPCSA and treat personal information in line with POPIA.

## How we approach care

Health concerns can be complex. We take time to understand your goals and circumstances, gather relevant history, and perform an examination when indicated. We then discuss options, outline potential benefits and limits, and decide together on next steps. Where a service is not appropriate for your situation, we’ll advise alternatives or referral pathways.

## Training and quality

Our team maintains ongoing professional development and follows evidence‑informed guidelines where appropriate. We review processes regularly and welcome constructive feedback. This helps us provide a dependable service and identify areas for improvement.

## Respect, access, and inclusion

We aim to provide a respectful environment for all patients and visitors. If you need language support, mobility access, or other reasonable accommodations, please let our team know in advance so we can plan appropriately within the limits of our facilities.

## Fees and consent

Fees and payment options are shared upfront. Informed consent is an ongoing process; we encourage questions at any point in your visit. You can request a copy of relevant practice policies or ask for clarifications about any part of your care.

## Privacy and data protection

We collect health information for clinical purposes and keep it secure in line with POPIA. Information is only shared when required by law, with your consent, or where necessary for your care. If you have privacy questions, please speak to a team member or contact us.
