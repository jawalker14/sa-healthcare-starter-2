This Privacy Policy explains how our healthcare practice ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you interact with our website, contact us, or receive care from our practice. We process personal information in accordance with the Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013 (POPIA), applicable healthcare laws, and professional ethical rules.

- From medical schemes for funding/claims (as applicable)
- Automatically via our website (cookies and similar technologies)

We process personal information on one or more lawful grounds under POPIA, including:

- Your consent
- To conclude or perform a contract (e.g., booking and providing care)
- To comply with legal and professional obligations
- To protect legitimate interests (e.g., practice administration, security)

Where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time. Withdrawal does not affect processing that has already occurred or processing required by law.

- To provide clinical care and coordinate treatment
- For billing, claims, and practice administration
- To improve our services and website
- For security, fraud prevention, and compliance

We do not use special personal information (such as health information) for direct marketing.

## Cookies and analytics

Our website may use necessary cookies for functionality and optional analytics to understand aggregate usage. If analytics are enabled (e.g., Google Analytics 4), data is processed in a way that does not identify you directly. You can control non-essential cookies through your browser settings.

## WhatsApp and online forms

If you contact us via online forms or WhatsApp, we will process the information you provide to handle your enquiry and schedule care. Please avoid sharing sensitive details over unsecured channels. We will move your information into our clinical systems where appropriate.

## Third-party disclosures and operators

We may share information with trusted service providers (operators) who assist us with:

- Hosting, email, IT support, and data storage
- Appointment scheduling and communication tools
- Billing, payment processing, and medical scheme claims
- Analytics (if enabled) and website performance

These providers process information on our instructions, are bound by confidentiality and POPIA-compliant agreements, and may be located outside South Africa. Where cross-border transfers occur, we take steps required by POPIA to ensure adequate protection.

We do not sell personal information.

## Retention

We retain records only as long as necessary for the purpose collected and as required by law and professional rules. Healthcare records are kept for the minimum periods required under applicable regulations.

## Security

We implement reasonable, appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information, including:

- Encryption in transit for our website
- Access controls and least-privilege practices
- Secure backups and system monitoring
- Staff confidentiality undertakings and training

No system can be guaranteed 100% secure. If we become aware of a data breach that may compromise your rights, we will notify you and the Information Regulator where required by law.

## Your rights under POPIA

Subject to limits in law, you have the right to:

- Be informed about how your information is used

## Direct marketing

We will only send electronic direct marketing with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law, and you can opt out at any time.

## Children and special personal information

Health information is special personal information under POPIA and receives enhanced protection. Where treatment involves minors, consent will be obtained from a competent person as required by law.

## Cross-border transfers

If personal information is transferred outside South Africa, we will ensure the recipient is subject to a law, binding corporate rules, or binding agreement that provides an adequate level of protection as required by POPIA, or we will obtain your consent where appropriate.
