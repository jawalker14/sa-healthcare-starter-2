		<Card title="General consultation">
			Many concerns can be addressed during a standard consultation. We’ll start with your history and current goals, examine where appropriate, and discuss practical next steps. This may include home care guidance, watch‑outs that warrant review, or investigations when clinically indicated. Where symptoms suggest a different level of care, we’ll advise on the most appropriate route. For general health topics, you can browse our <a href="/blog/welcome" className="underline">introductory resource</a>.

		<Card title="Chronic care management">
			Long‑term conditions benefit from regular, structured follow‑up. Together we’ll agree a monitoring plan, review results, and adjust treatment where appropriate. Plans may include lifestyle measures, medication reviews, and clear safety‑netting. If a service requires a different discipline or facility, we’ll coordinate referral pathways and share information with your consent so care remains connected.

		<Card title="Preventative screenings">
			Preventative care can support early detection and risk reduction. We’ll consider age, history, and current guidance to determine what is appropriate for you, then explain expected benefits and limitations. Results are discussed in plain language with next steps where needed. Some screenings may require external facilities; if so, we’ll outline options and timeframes.

## How appointments work

Most visits begin with history, an examination where appropriate, and a discussion of options. We’ll agree on next steps together and arrange follow‑up if needed. If virtual follow‑up is suitable, we’ll outline what that entails and any limitations.

## Fees and medical aid

Fees and payment options are shared upfront. Selected medical aids may be supported; please confirm current details with reception. If your plan does not cover a service, we’ll discuss options before proceeding.
