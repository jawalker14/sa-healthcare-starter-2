## How appointments work

Most visits begin with history, an examination where appropriate, and a discussion of options. We’ll agree on next steps together and arrange follow‑up if needed. If virtual follow‑up is suitable, we’ll outline what that entails and any limitations.

## Fees and medical aid

Fees and payment options are shared upfront. Selected medical aids may be supported; please confirm current details with reception. If your plan does not cover a service, we’ll discuss options before proceeding.
